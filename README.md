encfs-java
==========

encfs-java is a Java library for accessing data in
[EncFS](http://www.arg0.net/encfs) volumes. It is able to derive the volume key
from a user password, decode encrypted filenames (IV chaining is implemented),
decrypt file contents, create new volumes, move/copy/rename files and
directories within the volume as well as encrypt file contents into the
volume

We do support all encfs volume configuration options, and are interoperable
with the official encfs implementation (http://www.arg0.net/encfs). Currently
we only support volume created with the latest version (1.7.4), but we target
to be able to support volumes created with legacy versions as well.

## Building

encfs-java uses [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) for building. Assuming you
have a working installation, simply run the following to build the code:

    $ mvn compile

To create a JAR file for using encfs-java from another application, do:

    $ mvn package

Which will create a JAR file in the {$PROJECT_ROOT}/target/ directory.

## Usage

This library comes with a demo/example application called EncFSShell. It is a
simple shell supporting a few commands such as 'ls', 'cd', 'cat', 'mv' and 'cp'
on an EncFS volume. After building the library, add the
{$PROJECT_ROOT}/target/classes/ directory to your CLASSPATH, and run like so:

    $ java -classpath ${PROJECT_ROOT}/target/classes EncFSShell /path/to/an/encfs/volume

For using the library from another project, include the .JAR file in your
classpath and import the org.mrpdaemon.encfs.sec package.s

## API Documentation

For API documentation, see:

http://mrpdaemon.github.com/encfs-java/apidocs/index.html

To test your own comment changes, generate up-to-date docs using Maven:

    $ mvn javadoc:javadoc

Which will place your documentation in ${PROJECT_ROOT}/target/site/apidocs/

## Common issues

If you are getting an exception due to "Illegal key size" and you are using Sun's JDK,
you need to install the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction
Policy Files. See the following link for more information:

Java 8 JCE Link http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html
Extract files into JDK/JRE/lib/security folder (To whichever version of JRE/JDK x64/x86 you are using)
